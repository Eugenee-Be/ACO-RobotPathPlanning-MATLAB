# Convergence 

This week should finalise the experiment model.

## ðŸ“– Week 8 Meeting on Monday 21 March 2022 - Outlines
  * The ants should converge to the optimal solution in the end.
  * Try visualise the process: from arbitrarily-generated path to the pheromone-guided-generated path.
  * Compare results from different sets of parameters: the number of ants, the number of iterations and pheromone evaporation rate.
  * Mann-whitney test
  * Imitate the excellent example sent by Dr Castellani
