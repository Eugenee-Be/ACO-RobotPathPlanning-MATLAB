<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**Why robot path planning matters**: Picture a robot in your local warehouse, deftly weaving through stacks of boxes to fulfill your online shopping orders. Or imagine self-driving cars effortlessly navigating complex city streets. It's all about efficient path planning! üì¶üöó

Robot path planning is like a GPS for robots. It helps them find the best way from A to B while dodging obstacles, saving time, and conserving energy. It's the brain behind the bots!

**Enter Ant Colony Optimisation!** Now, here's where it gets exciting. We're introducing ACO, a nature-inspired algorithm that mimics how ants find the shortest path to food. üêúüçî

ACO is our robot's secret sauce. It's like giving them a sixth sense for navigating tricky terrains. By laying down 'virtual pheromones,' our robots learn and adapt, discovering the optimal routes in changing environments.

### A glimpse at the artificial ant colony

Take a look at the final outcome of the work!

![](image/Demo.gif)

* üéûÔ∏è Above animation visualises how the **artificial ant colony** navigate in a world full of obstacles.
* üßÄ Their goal is to identify the best (shortest and obstacle-free) route from their nest üü¢ to the food resources üî¥.
* ‚õµ **Exploration**: They firstly bravely explore many possible routes because of no prior knowledge of the world.
* üßî **Learn from excellent peers**: Then they quickly learn from their past experiences.
* ü•á **Team work wins!** Eventually, all of them merge on the optimal route!

### How it works

- :ant: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is like a picnic adventure for ants!
- :sandwich: Ants need to find the shortest path to their favorite sandwich.
- :world_map: Many paths to choose from, no GPS for ants!
- :walking_man: Ants leave scented breadcrumbs called **'pheromones'** as they explore.
- :nose: Strong pheromone smell means "This way to the sandwich!"
- :walking_woman: Other ants **follow the strong pheromone trail**.
- :briefcase: More ants travel the same path, making the trail even stronger.
- :railway_track: Ants **converge** on the shortest, most efficient route.
- :robot: ACO mimics this natural process to solve complex problems for computers.
- :exploding_head: Helps robots find their way through mazes and optimises delivery routes.
- :earth_americas: Nature's way of showing us how to navigate the world, one picnic at a time! :ant::sandwich::world_map:

## Getting started



## Archived Logs

The following is archived records of edit history.

### Update dates & details
Ver. 17 Mar 2022
* Bug cleared
* No obstacles in the map
  ```
  numAnts = 17;
  numGen = 20;
  ```
* To ensure to find the diagonal-shortest path, deployed precedent parameters

Ver. 20 Mar 2022
* Added obstacles to the map
  ```
  gripMap(2:9, 5) = 1;
  ```
  * Ran well, but need to improve the accuracy and stability

* Solved a fail-to-detect-obstacles issue
  * When using the Delta_r2r(arr) function, globalDelta stored obstacles in the array by mistake.
  * Bug source still not found
